I'm a junior student from School of ECE, Zhejiang University. My research interest includes robotics, computer vision and deep learning. 

I received the National Scholarship twice, and have won the 2nd place in the ICRA2022 General Place Recognition Competition. For more information, you can find my resume here: [Yixuan Li's Resume](../assets/Yixuan_Li.pdf).
