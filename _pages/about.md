I'm a third-year undergraduate student from School of ECE, Zhejiang University. My research interest includes computer vision, robotics, deep learning and optoelectronics. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Huiliang Shen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/shenhl) of IVLab. I was advised by [Prof. Haoliang Qian](https://person.zju.edu.cn/haoliangqian).

I received the National Scholarship twice, and have won the 2nd place in the ICRA2022 General Place Recognition Competition. For more information, you can find my resume here: [Yixuan Li's Resume](../assets/Yixuan_Li.pdf).
