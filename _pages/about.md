I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Washington, Seattle. My research focuses on quantum optics and nanophotonics. I work with Professor [Kai-Mei Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hiLdE6wAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), studying defects in ZnO that are promising candidates for quantum computing and quantum information processing.

I spent a wonderful time working with Professor [Haoliang Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=9atjlF8AAAAJ) on several projects of nanophotonics and optical signal processing from May 2022 to Dec 2022.

My previous interests also include computer vision and robotics. I won 2nd place in the General Place Recognition Competition held by ICRA 2022 and CMU Robotics Institute in October 2022. I collaborated with Dr. Lun Luo on the localization problem in autonomous driving from June 2022 to March 2023.

I received the National Scholarship (0.2% nationwide) twice and am in the Zhejiang University [Morningside Cultural China Scholars Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DXaS8qfygF_hEL96wzMXTAsjxo1aShGV/view?usp=drive_link).

# Miscellaneous
Outside of school and research, you'll probably catch me reading or zooming around on an aimless walk. I am a fan of Dostoevsky and Wang Xiaobo. I am also very interested (but an amateur) in photography, cycling, and classical music. Peanut butter is my serious weakness.
