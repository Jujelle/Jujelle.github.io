I’m a senior at the School of Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University. My primary research interests are nanophotonics and quantum optics. I hope my future research can contribute to the development of next-generation technologies, such as optical and quantum computing, and to provide benefits for applications such as bioimaging and communication. I spent a wonderful time working with Professor [Haoliang Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=9atjlF8AAAAJ) on several projects of nanophotonics and optical signal processing from May 2022 to Dec 2022.

My previous interests also include computer vision and robotics. I won 2nd place in the General Place Recognition Competition held by ICRA 2022 and CMU Robotics Institute in October 2022. I collaborated with Dr. Lun Luo on the localization problem in autonomous driving from June 2022 to March 2023.

I received the National Scholarship (0.2% nationwide) twice and am in the Zhejiang University [Morningside Cultural China Scholars Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DXaS8qfygF_hEL96wzMXTAsjxo1aShGV/view?usp=drive_link) (selected 30 out of 5,000 students each year). We visited 50+ guests from academic, political and business sectors during the summer of 2023, including the presidents of MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the America Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS).

# Miscellaneous
Outside of school and research, you'll probably catch me reading or zooming around on an aimless walk. I’m a fan of Dostoevsky and Wang Xiaobo. I'm also very interested (but an amateur) in photography, cycling, and classical music. Peanut butter is my serious weakness.
