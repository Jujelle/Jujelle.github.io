This blog is in memory of a journey back in the summer of 2023. 

In May 2023, after a three-year pause due to the pandemic, the Morningside Cultural China Scholars Program kickstarted its summer academic tour. A group of young students embarked on their journey from the East to the West Coast of the U.S., spanning seven cities, and meeting with over 50 distinguished guests. Every step of this trip was meticulously planned and executed by ourselves, from mapping the itinerary to initiating contact. We engaged with diverse cultures and conversed with some of the brightest minds. We had the opportunity to see the world, understand China, and uncover the depths of our own selves. This journey has become a precious pearl for my soul to cherish.
